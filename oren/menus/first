This file contains helpful information for getting started.  It is shown
to you automatically the first time you log into OREN.  If you wish to
review it later, just remember to type intro at the prompt.

You have logged into a host on the OREN.  This host uses an operating
system called Unix.  An introduction to Unix can be reviewed by typing

intro

at the command prompt.  To move to a new page, press the space bar.  To
quit before the end of the document, type q and a return.  When you've
finished with this page of the document, you should type a space and a
carriage return also (we're using more to print this on your terminal).

To log off of the system, type

logout

at the command prompt.  All commands end with a carriage return.
If you have serious problems, hang up the phone and your session will
be killed later so that you can try again.

A gripe program exists to allow you to easily enter complaints about
problems or suggestions (polite please) or requests for additional 
services.  To use gripe type

gripe

at the command prompt.  Follow the directions and enter your comments.
You will be contacted by email as a followup to your gripe.

A menu base system to help  new users is available by typing

menu

at the command prompt.
Other topics are available from intro.  To see a list of topics type

intro index

at the command prompt.  You may then type intro followed by the desired
subject.

Now this text will end.  Try typing 

intro

at the command line prompt.  Remember to finish with a carriage return.
Thanks
