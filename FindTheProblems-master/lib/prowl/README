     --~~ About ~~--
     
     Prowl rocks! It's a webapp and a iPhone app that works
     together and lets you send push notifications via HTTP
     to any iPhone that has the prowl app installed.
     
          Prowl.add(
            :apikey => "api key abc123def456",
            :application => "World Saving Project Manager",
            :event => "Canceled",
            :description => "It sucked, so I canceled it. Sorry :("
          )

      The user has given you its API key. That lets you
      send push notifications to the users iPhone, through
      the Prowl iPhone app.
      
      
      --~~ Usage ~~--
      
      Four required parameters:
          
          :apikey (string / array of strings)
          :application (string)
          :event (string)
          :description (string)
          
      You can use Prowl.add, or create instances of Prowl
      manually.
      
      Prowl.add(:apikey => "123abc", :application => "Foo", ...)
      Prowl.verify("apikey")
  
      p = Prowl.new(:apikey => "apikey123abc", :application => "FooApp")
      p.valid?
      p.add(:event => "It's valid", ...)
